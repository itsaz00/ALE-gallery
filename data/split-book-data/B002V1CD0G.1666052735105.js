Within six months of its publication in 1936, <i>Gone With the Wind</i> had sold a million copies. To date, it has been translated into 25 languages, and more than 28 million copies have been sold. <p>Here are the characters that have become symbols of passion and desire: darkly handsome Rhett Butler and flirtatious Scarlett O'Hara. Behind them stand their gentler counterparts: Ashley Wilkes and Melanie Hamilton. As the lives and affairs of these absorbing characters play out against the tumult of the Civil War, <i>Gone With the Wind</i> reaches dramatic heights that have swept generations of fans off their feet.</p> <p>Having lived in Atlanta for many years, narrator Linda Stephens has an authentic ear for the dialects of that region. Get ready to hear <i>Gone With the Wind</i> exactly as it was written: every word beautifully captured in a spectacular unabridged audio production.</p>";
