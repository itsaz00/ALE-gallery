window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>One of the genre's favorite pairs returns in a classic fantasy short for both Riyria veterans and first-time readers.&nbsp;</p> <p>Several years have passed since the war-weary mercenary Hadrian and cynical ex-assassin Royce joined forces to start their thieves-for-hire organization better known as Riyria. Things have gone well enough for the team as they do \"jobs\" for various nobles throughout Elan. Usually that means stealing something, but when a young heiress asks them to steal herâ€¦well, that's a first for the pair. All is not as it seems, but Royce is determined to get the bottom of what's actually going on. After all, he has his professional integrity at stake.</p> <p>Originally released in the Blackguards anthology published by Ragnarok Publications, this is a standalone short story of 10,800 words. No prior knowledge of The Riyria Revelations or The Riyria Chronicles is required to enjoy it to its fullest, making this a perfect introduction for new readers or a chance for existing fans to spend a little more time with old friends.</p>";
