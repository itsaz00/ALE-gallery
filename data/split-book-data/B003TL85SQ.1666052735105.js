As Facebook spreads around the globe, it creates surprising effects - even becoming instrumental in political protests.</p><p>Veteran technology reporter David Kirkpatrick had the full cooperation of Facebook's key executives in researching this fascinating history. Kirkpatrick tells us how Facebook was created, why it has flourished, and where it is going next. He chronicles its successes and missteps, and gives readers the most complete assessment anywhere of founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the central figure in the company's remarkable ascent. This is the Facebook story that can be found nowhere else.</p><p>Kirkpatrick shows how Zuckerberg refused to compromise, insistently focusing on growth over profits and preaching that Facebook must dominate (his word) communication on the Internet. In the process, he and a small group of key executives have created a company that has changed social life in the United States and elsewhere, a company that has become a ubiquitous presence in marketing, and one that has altered politics, business, and even our sense of our own identity. This is the Facebook Effect.</p><p>This special edition also includes an <b>exclusive conversation</b> between the author and Randi Zuckerberg, who offers unique insight as a marketer at Facebook and the CEO's sister. You'll hear them talk about major company milestones, high-profile product launches, and the CEO's growth - emotionally and experientially - as a leader. They also discuss the controversial issues surrounding Facebook's privacy policies.</p>";
